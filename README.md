# Sudoku Solver with AI - Partial Implementation

This project contains a partial implementation of an AI agent to solve diagonal Sudoku puzzles using constraint propagation and search strategies. It focuses on the `solution.py` file, which was developed as part of the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Program (Course 1: Sudoku Solver).

**Note**: This repository does not contain the full project setup or all the requirements necessary for running the complete Sudoku solver. It only includes the core solving logic implemented in `solution.py`.

## Features

- Implementation of the "naked twins" strategy
- Support for diagonal Sudoku puzzles
- Constraint propagation and search algorithms

## File Description

- `solution.py`: Contains the main implementation of the Sudoku solving algorithms, including:
  - Naked twins strategy
  - Constraint propagation
  - Search algorithms for solving Sudoku puzzles

## Usage

As this is a partial implementation, you cannot run the solver directly. The `solution.py` file is meant to be integrated into the full Udacity project environment.

## Important Note

This repository does not include the entire project setup or all necessary dependencies as requested by the course license. It is intended to showcase the core solving logic implemented in `solution.py`.

## Acknowledgments

This project was completed as part of the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Program. The implementation in `solution.py` was developed to meet the project requirements while adhering to the course license agreement.
